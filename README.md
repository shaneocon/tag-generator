# Tag Generator (Final Project/Project 3)

# Description:

This application allows the user to generate an HTML script that contains the user's selected preferences from a list of framework. The user of this application will have to sign up to create an account. Once the user has an account, then the user can select a framework from a list of frameworks. The framework selected will be generated in the form of a script and it will be attached/added to the HTML script tag. The user then can save the script tag that was generated onto his account.

# User Story:

As a Web Developer, I want an application that will allow me to save time by generating an HTML script tag containing my desired framework scripts when I click a button. I want to be able to save my preferences in my own private account.

# Installation: 

Start by installing Front End and Back End dependencies by running the command;

    - npm install

This will install node modules within the server folder and the client folder.

You can add as many necessary dependencies and libraries to your project by running npm [library name and/or program].

Once the installations are completed, the user can run the following command;

    - npm start

The application will deploy on the user's localhost 3000 or 3001 port, depending on what port the user has selected to deploy the application.
